# easy-video-embed

easy-video-embed dynamically embeds YouTube & Vimeo videos on your page, as you type! Perfect for a CMS where you want to show your user the result, without making them save the page and reloading it.


Current working implementation written with a jQuery dependency - future version will remove the dependency :heart:
